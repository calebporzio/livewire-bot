ðŸ‘‹ Oh Hi! I'm Squishy, the friendly jellyfish that manages Livewire issues.

I see this issue has been closed.

Here in the Livewire repo, we have an "issues can be closed guilt-free and without explanation" policy.

If for ANY reason you think this issue hasn't been resolved, PLEASE feel empowered to re-open it.

Re-opening actually helps us track which issues are a priority.

Reply "REOPEN" to this comment and we'll happily re-open it for you!
